Sabah 
Borneo, is an island in that is just north of Australia and smack dab in the middle of the Indian Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean where the land meets the sea. Sabah, is the northern region of Borneo. Its often reffered to as the land beneath the wind. Mount Kinabalu stands like it is a natural lighthouse, and has undeniable beauty. It is something to see in person. There, under the shroud of the cloud splitting mountain, lives many groups of people. Villages are peppered into lands from the sea to the Kinabalu Park of Mount Kinabalu. 

The people there are reslient and knit into the communities around them. 
Kota Kinabalu is one of the cities there, Sandakan is the east side of north Borneo. Ranau is one town there that I like. There has always been a rich history to all of Borneo, especially with its native subcultures and indigenous groups. From my perspective, many people are stll trying to preserve the history of orang original sabahan. I am not privy to the a lot of the history or knowledge yet, but I know some orang Kadazan.


 some stories I found:

One story is of Kinoingan and the sacrifice of Huminodun to feed and save humanity. It is a story that provides insight into the origins of "Kaamatan" or the Harvest festival. A telling of this story can be read on "[The Flying Dusun]"

Another is the origin place of all of the tribes in Borneo. Nunuk Ragang, a giant red Bayan fig tree was said to be the first shared Kadazan dusun home. Many versions of this origin story are told a simple version is captured on [MomogunTV]'s website

Lastly, the story of the Joker and the Dragon.
