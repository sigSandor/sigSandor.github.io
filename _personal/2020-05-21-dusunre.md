## <span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">Who are the Kadazan Dusun?</span>

![flag](/assets/flag.jpg)


The "Orang Dusun", "Kadazan-Dusun", or "Kadazan" refers to a larger group of indigenous subgroups and aboriginal people from the island of Borneo (these terms mostly refer to Sabahans). They were often refferred to as such by visiting groups from hundreds of years, or perhaps even thousands of years ago. The meaning of the words are similar to "People of the orchard". 

Of the many ethnic groups that comprise the Kadazan-Dusun, there is a very rich history of many cultures.
With the introduction of the internet, it is a lot more accessible nowadays.
Although, a majority of the Kadazan-Dusun's sub-ethnic history is passed down through words and spoken stories, and is not written or recorded.

My goal is to have this page be a way for me to connect and preserve what history and culture that *is* recorded, and also to share and persuade others to visit gorgegous land preserves such as [Kinabalu Park]!

Additionally, there are a couple legends that transcend time. 
One is of Kinoingan and the sacrifice of Huminodun. It is a story that provides insight into the origins of "Kaamatan" or the Harvest festival. A version of the story can be read on "[The Flying Dusun]"

Another is the origin place of all of the tribes in Borneo. Nunuk Ragang, a giant red Bayan tree, or a special fig tree was said to be the home of the shared Kadazan dusun ancestors. Many versions of the story are told and a particular one I like is written on [MomogunTV]'s website
