## <span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">Who are the Kadazan Dusun?</span>
Dusun/Kadazandusun refers to a larger group of indigenous subgroups from the island of Borneo (Kadazan mostly refer to Sabahans). They were often refferred to as such by themseleves, as well as visiting groups from hundreds of years, or perhaps even thousands of years ago is what some books write. The meaning of the words are similar to "People of the orchard". There is no way to know how old the people of borneo are. 

A majority of the Kadazan-Dusun's ethnic history is passed down through words and was not often written or recorded.

My goal is to have this page be a way for me to hold the knowledge we have in this point in time. It allows me to connect and preserve what history and culture was out there before me, and also to share and persuade others to visit gorgeous land preserves such as [Kinabalu Park]!!

Additionally, there are a couple of stories/folklore that I enjoy sharing:

One story is of Kinoingan and the sacrifice of Huminodun to feed and save humanity. It is a story that provides insight into the origins of "Kaamatan" or the Harvest festival. A telling of this story can be read on "[The Flying Dusun]"

Another is the origin place of all of the tribes in Borneo. Nunuk Ragang, a giant red Bayan fig tree was said to be the first shared Kadazan dusun home. Many versions of this origin story are told a simple version is captured on [MomogunTV]'s website

Lastly, the story of the Joker and the Dragon.
