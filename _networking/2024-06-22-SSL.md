### <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Basics for Beginners</span>


###### IN PROGRESS ***June 18, 2024***

- KQL is Cloud native, and designed to query large data sets.

- WORM language (Write Once Read Many)

> These 2 links will show you how to set up a free Azure Data Explorer to test the upcoming Query basics.

## LAW (Log Analytic Workspace)

- Purpose: Part of Azure Monitor, it is specifically focused on collecting, analyzing, and querying log and telemetry data from Azure services, on-premises environments, and other cloud environments. It's geared towards IT operational intelligence, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

- Query Language: Also uses Kusto Query Language `KQL`

- Data Types: Primarily focused on logs and telemetry data for the purpose of monitoring, diagnostics, and troubleshooting of IT infrastructure and applications.

- Performance: Optimized for operational data analysis. While it can handle large volumes of data, the primary focus is on providing insights for IT operations and monitoring.

- Use Cases: Ideal for infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, security information and event management (SIEM), and compliance tracking.

## ADX (Azure Data Explorer)

- Purpose: ADX is a big data analytics platform optimized for interactive queries on large volumes of data. It's designed to analyze, visualize, and explore data from various applications, websites, IoT devices, and more.

- Query Language: Uses Kusto Query Language `KQL`

- Data Types: While it can handle logs, it's also designed to work with a wider variety of data types, including metrics, time-series data, and telemetry from various sources.

- Performance: ADX is highly optimized for performance, being able to query millions if not billions of records in an instant.

- Use Cases: Ideal for real-time analytics, IoT applications, telemetry data, customer and operational analytics, and scenarios requiring fast analysis of large datasets.
