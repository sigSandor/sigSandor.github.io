    "title": "Mermaid diagram code blocks",
    "content": "New (v0.4.0) . Mermaid allows you to add diagrams and visualizations using Markdown code blocks. It is disabled by default. However, you can turn on support for mermaid by adding a mermaid key to your _config.yml. The minimum configuration requires a version key (matching a version in jsDelivr): . mermaid: # Version of mermaid library # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/ version: \"9.1.3\" . Additional configuration options are loaded through _includes/mermaid_config.js. By default, the contents of the file are the empty object: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js {} . This loads the default settings. The contents of this object should follow mermaid’s configuration API. For example, to override the theme, change _includes/mermaid_config.js to: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js { theme: \"forest\" } . Once mermaid is installed, it can be used in markdown files. The markdown for a simple flowchart example might look like the following: . ```mermaid graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; ``` . which renders: . graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; . Note: for demonstration purposes, we’ve enabled mermaid on this site. It is still disabled by default, and users need to opt-in to use it. Using a local mermaid library . To load a local version of mermaid, also use the path key to specify the location of the library; e.g. mermaid: version: \"10.1.0\" # for (v10+) path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.esm.min.mjs\" # for (&lt;v10): # path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.min.js\" # Note: copy both `mermaid.esm.min.mjs` (v10+) or `mermaid.min.js` (&lt;v10) and the associated # `.map` file from the specified version of `mermaid/dist` to `/assets/js/`. For mermaid versions &gt;=10, this file is imported directly as an ESM module (rather than as a plain &lt;script&gt; tag); users should use the mermaid.esm.min.mjs file. In contrast, for mermaid versions &lt;10, this file is loaded as a script tag; it should be a standalone CJS file (i.e. mermaid.min.js). Mermaid versions 10.0 - 10.1 (and possibly, future releases) still encode relative imports in mermaid.esm.min.mjs. Local users must copy all of the contents of the dist folder to the specified path (preserving the relative location of the files). Just the Docs is actively monitoring mermaid releases; an upstream fix is planned. Using mermaid with AsciiDoc . Users of AsciiDoc (e.g. via jekyll-asciidoc) may need additional configuration to use mermaid. By default, AsciiDoc generates HTML markup that mermaid cannot properly parse. The simplest way to resolve this is to use a passthrough block: . ++++ &lt;pre class=\"language-mermaid\"&gt; graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; &lt;/pre&gt; ++++ . Alternatively, community member @flyx has contributed a Ruby extension that does not require extra markup. The extension is available as a GitHub Gist. Thank you to @flyx! . The asciidoctor-diagram extension which also supports mermaid is not recommended for use with Just the Docs, since it requires separate configuration e.g. for theming, and is known to not be trivial to set up.

The colors grey-lt, grey-dk, purple, blue, green, yellow, and red are predefined; to use a custom color, you need to define its 000 and 300 levels in your SCSS files.

If you want to add a scheme named foo (can be any name) just add a file _sass/color_schemes/foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) where you override theme variables to change colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Since the default color scheme is light, your custom scheme is implicitly based on the variable settings used by the light scheme. If you want your custom scheme to be based on the dark scheme, you need to start your file with the following line: . @import \"./color_schemes/dark\"; . You can define custom schemes based on other custom schemes in the same way. Available variables are listed in the _variables.scss file. For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, include the following inside your scheme file: . Example . $link-color: $blue-000; . Keep in mind that changing a variable will not automatically change the value of other variables that depend on it. For example, the default link color ($link-color) is set to $purple-000. However, redefining $purple-000 in a custom color scheme will not automatically change $link-color to match it. Instead, each variable that relies on previously-cascaded values must be manually reimplemented by copying the dependent rules from _variables.scss — in this case, rewriting $link-color: $purple-000;. Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. Please use scheme files. Use a custom scheme . To use the custom color scheme, only set the color_scheme parameter in your site’s _config.yml file: . color_scheme: foo . Switchable custom scheme . If you want to be able to change the scheme dynamically, for example via javascript, just add a file assets/css/just-the-docs-foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) with the following content: . --- --- {% include css/just-the-docs.scss.liquid color_scheme=\"foo\" %} .

New (v0.4.0) . _includes/toc_heading_custom.html . If the page has any child pages, and has_toc is not set to false, this content appears as a heading above the auto-generating list of child pages after the page’s content. Example . To change the default TOC heading to “Contents”, create _includes/toc_heading_custom.html and add: . &lt;h2 class=\"text-delta\"&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt; . The (optional) text-delta class makes the heading appear as Contents . Custom Footer . _includes/footer_custom.html . This content appears at the bottom of every page’s main content. More info for this include can be found in the Configuration - Footer content. Custom Head . _includes/head_custom.html . Any HTML added to this file will be inserted before the closing &lt;head&gt; tag. This might include additional &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, or &lt;script&gt; tags. The &lt;head&gt; tag automatically includes a link to an existing favicon if you set favicon_ico to the corresponding path in your configuration, or if the path to the favicon is /favicon.ico. Custom Header . _includes/header_custom.html . Content added to this file appears at the top of every page’s main content between the site search and auxiliary links if they are enabled. If search_enabled were set to false and aux_links were removed, the content of header_custom.html would occupy the space at the top of every page. Custom Nav Footer .

    "content": "New (v0.4.0) . Advanced . Just the Docs uses Jekyll’s powerful layouts and includes features to generate and compose various elements of the site. Jekyll users and developers can extend or replace existing layouts and includes to customize the entire site layout. Default layout and includable components . The default layout is inherited by most of the “out-of-the-box” pages provided by Just the Docs. It composes various re-usable components of the site, including the sidebar, navbar, footer, breadcrumbs, and various imports. Most users who create new pages or layouts will inherit from default. Here is a simplified code example of what it looks like: . &lt;!-- a simplified version of _layouts/default.html --&gt; &lt;html&gt; {% include head.html %} &lt;body&gt; {% include icons/icons.html %} {% include components/sidebar.html %} {% include components/header.html %} {% include components/breadcrumbs.html %} {% if site.heading_anchors != false %} {% include vendor/anchor_headings.html html=content ... %} {% else %} {{ content }} {% endif %} {% if page.has_children == true and page.has_toc != false %} {% include components/children_nav.html %} {% endif %} {% include components/footer.html %} {% if site.search_enabled != false %} {% include components/search_footer.html %} {% endif %} {% if site.mermaid %} {% include components/mermaid.html %} {% endif %} &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Component summary . Defining a new _includes with the same name as any of these components will significantly change the existing layout. Please proceed with caution when adjusting them. To briefly summarize each component: . | _includes/head.html is the entire &lt;head&gt; tag for the site; this imports stylesheets, various JavaScript files (ex: analytics, mermaid, search, and Just the Docs code), and SEO / meta information. | _includes/icons/icons.html imports all SVG icons that are used throughout the site. Some, such as those relating to search or code snippet copying, are only loaded when those features are enabled. | _includes/components/sidebar.html renders the sidebar, containing the site header, navigation links, external links, collections, and nav footer. | _includes/components/header.html renders the navigation header, containing the search bar, custom header, and aux links | _includes/components/breadcrumbs.html renders the breadcrumbs feature | vendor/anchor_headings.html is a local copy of Vladimir Jimenez’s jekyll-anchor-headings snippet | _includes/components/children_nav.html renders a list of nav links to child pages on parent pages | _includes/components/footer.html renders the bottom-of-page footer | _includes/components/search_footer.html renders DOM elements that are necessary for the search bar to work | _includes/components/mermaid.html initializes mermaid if the feature is enabled | . Each of these components can be overridden individually using the same process described in the Override includes section. In particular, the granularity of components should allow users to replace certain components (such as the sidebar) without having to adjust the rest of the code. Future versions may subdivide components further; we guarantee that we will only place them in folders (ex components/, icons/, or a new js/) to avoid top-level namespace collisions. Alternative layouts and example (minimal) . Users can develop custom layouts that compose, omit, or add components differently. We provide one first-class example titled minimal, which disables the navigation sidebar. To see an example, visit the minimal layout test page. Users can indicate this alternative layout in page front matter: . --- layout: minimal title: Minimal layout test --- . Similarly, users and developers can create other alternative layouts using Just the Docs’ reusable includable components. Default layout and inheritance chain . Under the hood, . | default inherit from the table_wrappers layout, which wraps all HTML &lt;table&gt; tags with a div .table-wrapper | table_wrappers inherits from vendor/compress, which is a local copy of Anatol Broder’s jekyll-compress-html Jekyll plugin | . The minimal layout inherits from the default but assigns nav_enabled: false to disable the navigation sidebar. Overridden default Jekyll layouts . By default, Jekyll (and its default theme minima) provide the about, home, page, and post layouts. In Just the Docs, we override all of these layouts with the default layout. Each of those layouts is simply: . --- layout: default --- {{ content }} . ",

The default settings for HTML compression are incompatible with the HTML produced by Jekyll for line numbers from highlighted code – both when using Kramdown code fences and when using Liquid highlight tags. To avoid non-conforming HTML and unsatisfactory layout, HTML compression can be turned off by using the following configuration option: . compress_html: ignore: envs: all . When using Kramdown code fences, line numbers are turned on globally by the following configuration option: . kramdown: syntax_highlighter_opts: block: line_numbers: true .

This HTML is invalid; in particular, there are two issues: . | there are many missing closing tags, and a superfluous &gt;, which produce visually garbled output | a &lt;table&gt; is placed within a &lt;code&gt; element, which is syntactically invalid HTML (but is often allowed by browsers) | . To emphasize this first difference, here is the same markup output, indented by tag: . &lt;figure class=\"highlight\"&gt; &gt; &lt;code class=\"language-ruby\" data-lang=\"ruby\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"table-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;table class=\"rouge-table\"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class=\"gutter gl\"&gt; &lt;pre class=\"lineno\"&gt; 1 2 3 &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;td class=\"code\"&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"nf\"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"nb\"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s1\"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; . In order, there are missing &lt;/td&gt;, &lt;/td&gt;, &lt;/tr&gt;, &lt;/tbody&gt;, &lt;/table&gt;, &lt;/div&gt;, and &lt;/code&gt; tags. As a result, the following elements of the page - including the site footer - become visually garbled as browsers attempt to recover gracefully. Prior workarounds we suggested (such as Dmitry Hrabrov’s in jekyll-compress-html#71) resolve the missing tag problem. However, they still place a &lt;table&gt; within a &lt;code&gt; element. The HTML spec normatively states that &lt;code&gt; elements should only contain “phrasing content”, which does not include &lt;table&gt; (spec ref). To avoid incorrectly rendered HTML, the previously-suggested workaround using the current version of _includes/fix_linenos.html should not be used! . ",

To wrap up, in this module we set up 3 VMs. The 1st VM (Windows Server 2019) was configured to be the Domain Controller and the other 2 VMs (Windows 10 Enterprise) were configured as client devices. Additionally, on the DC VM, we enabled DHCP, set up DNS Forwarder, enabled AD Certificate Services and configured Policies to be applied to all devices that are part of the AD environment. You can delete the Windows Server 2019 ISO file if you do not want to store it for future use. Do not delete the Windows 10 Enterprise ISO just yet as we will require it to setup FlareVM. DNS &amp; DHCP Verification . To verify that the client VMs are indeed connected to the AD environment you can open DHCP Manager and compare the IP address shown with the IP address that has been assigned to the VM. Similarly, we can use DNS Manager to confirm that new DNS entries have been added for the client devices. Taking VM Snapshots . Snapshots can be taken with the VM in a running state but sometimes doing so can cause the VM to behave erratically. So I recommend “Powering off” all the VM before taking its Snapshot. Select the Windows Server 2019 VM. Click on the “Hamburger menu” and select Snapshots from the dropdown menu. Click on Take from the toolbar. Give the snapshot a descriptive name and click on OK. This will create a new Snapshot from the VM. Select the Windows 10 Enterprise VM1 from the sidebar and follow the above steps to create a Snapshot. Follow the same steps to create Snapshot for Windows 10 Enterprise VM2. Right-click on the hamburger menu and select “Details” to return to the VM configuration page. Alternative AD Setup . Many other features and services can enabled on the DC. Refer to the below links for variations on the installation process.

Interfaces that are created using the CLI will not show up in the Settings page for the VM. If you want to modify the adapter settings you have to do it using the CLI. Enabling the Interface . Start the pfSense VM. On boot, you will notice that there are still only 4 interfaces. The new interface has to be onboarded before it shows up in pfSense. Enter 1 to select “Assign Interfaces”. Should VLANs be set up now? n . Enter the WAN interface name: vtnet0 Enter the LAN interface name: vtnet1 Enter the Optional 1 interface name: vtnet2 Enter the Optional 2 interface name: vtnet3 Enter the Optional 3 interface name: vtnet4 . Do you want to proceed?: y . The new interface has been added. Now we need to assign the interface an IP address. Enter 2 to select “Set interface(s) IP address” Enter 5 to select the OPT3 interface. Configure IPv4 address OPT3 interface via DHCP?: n Enter the new OPT3 IPv4 address: 10.99.99.1 Enter the new OPT3 IPv4 subnet bit count: 24 . For the next question press Enter. Since we are configuring a LAN interface we do not have to worry about the upstream gateway. Configure IPv6 address OPT3 interface via DHCP6: n For the new OPT3 IPv6 address question press Enter. Do you want to enable the DHCP server on OPT3?: y Enter the start address of the IPv4 client address range: 10.99.99.11 Enter the end address of the IPv4 client address range: 10.99.99.243 Do you want to revert to HTTP as the webConfigurator protocol?: n . Now interface OPT3 will have an IP address. Renaming the Interface . Launch the Kali Linux VM. Login to the pfSense web portal. From the navigation bar select Interfaces -&gt; OPT3. In the description field enter ISOLATED. Scroll to the bottom and click on Save. Click on Apply Changes in the popup that appears to persist the changes. Interface Firewall Configuration . From the navigation bar click on Firewall -&gt; Rules. Select the ISOLATED tab. Click on the “Add” button to create a new rule. Change the values as follows: Action: Block Address Family: IPv4+IPv6 Protocol: Any Source: ISOLATED subnets Description: Block access to everything . Scroll to the bottom and click on Save. In the popup click on Apply Changes to persist the new rule. Since this Interface is going to be used for Malware Analysis we are blocking network access. This will ensure that malware cannot spread to other systems using the network. Reboot pfSense . Now we need to restart pfSense to ensure that the firewall rules are propagated properly. From the navigation bar select Diagnostics -&gt; Reboot. Click on Submit. Once pfSense boots up you will be redirected to the login page. ",

DNS Configuration . Since we enabled DNS on this machine (Domain Controller). This machine (DC) will act as the DNS server for devices that are connected to the ad.lab environment. For the DNS service to function properly we need to configure a Forwarder. Forwarder is the device to which the DNS queries will be sent when the DC cannot resolve it. In our case, we need to forward the request to pfSense. The DNS service of pfSense will then perform the lookup. Open the Start menu expand the “Windows Administrative Tools” folder and select DNS. In the sidebar select the Domain Controller (in my case DC1) and from the right menu double-click on “Forwarders”. Go to Forwarders -&gt; Edit. This will open the Forwarder configuration page.

We don’t have any Exclusions (static IP assignment). Leave all the options empty and click on Next. Increase the lease time to 365 days and click on Next. Since we increased the lease duration when a IP address is assigned to a device the device will be allowed to use that IP address without requesting a new IP address for 365 days.

So far we have installed Windows Server 2019, installed Guest Additions, configured the VM to be the Domain Controller (DC), set up a DNS Forwarder and configured DHCP.
