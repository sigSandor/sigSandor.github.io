# Email Security: DMARC (With SPF and DKIM)




### Email Authentication; a quick background
Email authentication technology is slow to change. SPF and DKIM were developed over 10 years ago, and the risk associated with email and fraudulent communication has only but grown.

{: .warning }
SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an previous email authentication method that allows the owner of a domain to specify which mail servers are permitted to send emails on behalf of that domain. It works by publishing SPF records in the domain's DNS, which receiving mail servers can check to verify the email's legitimacy and reduce spam and phishing.

Ex 1 | <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">myemailserv.com.</span>  <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">IN TXT</span>  <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ip4:192.0.2.0/24 -all"</span>

Ex 2 | myemailserv.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mailgun.org include:amazonses.com -all"
Ex  3 | myemailserv.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx a include:_spf.mail.yahoo.com -all"

- ***myemailserv.com*** specifies the <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Domain</span>
- ***IN TXT*** is comprised of the DNS type and Record. (<span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">IN</span> = Internet DNS class) (<span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">TXT</span> = Text File Record)

The <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span> section, denotes the actual SPF rule: 

- ***v=spf1*** specifies the SPF <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">version</span> used.
- ***include:_spf.~.com*** indicates that an organization's servers and subdomains are <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">authorized</span> to send emails on behalf of rule since it authorizes and _includes_ that specific domain. (google -> gmail or amazon -> amazonses)
- ***~all*** specifies that any mail servers not explicitly listed should soft fail (treated as suspicious but not necessarily rejected).


{: .warning }
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM lets the sender attach a digital signature to an email message, which can be verified by the recipient using the sender's public key published in the DNS. This ensures the message hasn't been altered and confirms its authenticity.

What are some roadblocks or barriers that email authentication faces currently? 
- Complex mail enviroments with 3rd party vendors, contractors, and service providers.
- The latter results in a mix of aggregated Un-authenticated and some Authenticated messages.
- The flow of internal vs external factors, the reciever's configuration vs the senders configuration. (Not enough shared information between senders and recievers.)

So how does DMARC work? 

DMARC was designed to slot into an organizations existing authentication proccesses.

To describe DMARC simply, the authentication method tests the alignment of a senders "Header" to what a Reciever has on record for that sender.
